# Thesis Art for Karolis Degutis
The idea of "thesis art" is to inspire discussion with persons who do not have an academic background or work in a different field. The thesis is hidden in the drawer, but the poster is out there at the wall for everyone to see. You can find all past thesis art pieces [here](https://benediktehinger.de/blog/science/category/thesis-art/)

# Code
this code makes use of Makie.jl, TravelingSalesmanHeuristics.jl and PDFIO.jl - all three great libraries!!
